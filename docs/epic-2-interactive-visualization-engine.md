# Epic 2: Interactive Visualization Engine

## Epic Goal

Implement a powerful, real-time visualization engine with multiple visual styles and customization options that enables users to create compelling, personalized music visualizations.

## Epic Description

**Primary Objective:** Build the core visualization engine with multiple predefined styles ("Data Viz", "Gradient Flow", "Light Waves") and comprehensive customization capabilities.

**Business Value:**
- Differentiates MidiViz from basic visualization tools
- Provides the creative flexibility users need for social media content
- Establishes premium feature set for monetization
- Enables user engagement through customization and experimentation

**Technical Scope:**
- Three distinct visualization styles using Three.js/WebGL
- Real-time rendering engine optimized for 60fps
- Custom color scheme creation and management
- Advanced MIDI data interpretation and mapping
- Interactive controls for real-time parameter adjustment

## User Stories

### Story 2.1: Visualization Style Framework
**As a developer**, I want a modular visualization framework so that I can easily add new visualization styles and maintain existing ones.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Abstract visualization base class with common interface
- [ ] Plugin architecture for adding new visualization styles
- [ ] Shared utilities for MIDI data processing and rendering
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization hooks
- [ ] Style-specific configuration management system

### Story 2.2: "Data Viz" Visualization Style
**As a user**, I want a data-driven visualization style so that I can create analytical, precise visual representations of my music.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Bar chart style with notes as vertical bars
- [ ] Configurable parameters: bar width, spacing, height scaling
- [ ] Real-time note velocity mapping to bar height/color intensity
- [ ] Multiple MIDI channels displayed as grouped or layered bars
- [ ] Smooth animations between note transitions
- [ ] Export quality optimized for high resolution rendering

### Story 2.3: "Gradient Flow" Visualization Style  
**As a user**, I want a flowing, organic visualization style so that I can create atmospheric, mood-based visuals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Particle system with gradient-based color transitions
- [ ] Note events trigger particle bursts and color changes
- [ ] Configurable parameters: particle count, flow speed, gradient intensity
- [ ] Velocity mapping to particle size and color saturation
- [ ] Smooth background gradient shifts based on harmonic content
- [ ] 60fps performance maintained with complex particle systems

### Story 2.4: "Light Waves" Visualization Style
**As a user**, I want a dynamic wave-based visualization so that I can create energetic, rhythm-focused visuals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Wave propagation system with customizable wave types
- [ ] Note events create ripple effects across the visualization
- [ ] Configurable parameters: wave speed, amplitude, frequency modulation
- [ ] Multi-layered wave interactions for complex musical passages
- [ ] Real-time audio analysis integration for wave behavior
- [ ] Optimized shader system for smooth wave rendering

### Story 2.5: Custom Color Scheme System
**As a user**, I want to create and save custom color schemes so that I can match my visualizations to my brand or artistic vision.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Color palette editor with hue, saturation, brightness controls
- [ ] Predefined color scheme library (10+ professional schemes)
- [ ] Custom color scheme creation and naming
- [ ] Color scheme sharing via URL or code
- [ ] Real-time color preview while editing
- [ ] Import/export color schemes in standard formats

### Story 2.6: Real-Time Parameter Controls
**As a user**, I want interactive controls to adjust visualization parameters in real-time so that I can fine-tune my creation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Intuitive slider and dial controls for key parameters
- [ ] Parameter presets for quick style variations
- [ ] Real-time parameter changes reflected immediately
- [ ] Parameter history/undo functionality
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common adjustments
- [ ] Mobile-friendly touch controls

## Technical Dependencies

**External:**
- Three.js library for WebGL rendering
- Web Audio API for audio analysis
- Modern browser WebGL support

**Internal:**
- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Upload (file handling, basic UI)
- MIDI parsing system from Epic 1

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three visualization styles implemented and performant
- [ ] Custom color scheme system fully functional
- [ ] Real-time controls responsive and intuitive
- [ ] 60fps performance maintained on target devices
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for visualization engine
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness optimized
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented (contrast, motion preferences)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Visualization rendering at stable 60fps on target hardware
- [ ] Custom color scheme creation completion rate > 70%
- [ ] User session duration increases by 40% vs basic visualization
- [ ] Style switching frequency indicates user engagement
- [ ] Mobile performance maintains 30fps minimum

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** WebGL performance issues on older devices
**Mitigation:** Implement fallback Canvas 2D renderer and performance monitoring
**Rollback Plan:** Basic Canvas 2D visualization with reduced features

**Secondary Risk:** Complex shader development complexity
**Mitigation:** Start with simpler effects and iterate, use proven shader libraries
**Rollback Plan:** CSS-based animations for basic effects

**Tertiary Risk:** Cross-browser WebGL compatibility
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive browser testing and WebGL capability detection
**Rollback Plan:** Canvas 2D fallback with feature detection

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Implement object pooling for particle systems
- Optimize shader compilation and WebGL state changes
- Progressive quality degradation based on performance metrics

**Architecture Patterns:**
- Strategy pattern for visualization style switching
- Observer pattern for real-time parameter updates
- Factory pattern for visualization component creation
- Command pattern for parameter history/undo functionality
