**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Stripe integration for payment processing
- [ ] Subscription tier management (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- [ ] Usage tracking and limit enforcement
- [ ] Billing dashboard with invoice history
- [ ] Subscription upgrade/downgrade flows
- [ ] Payment method management
- [ ] Automated billing and dunning management

### Story 3.6: User Account & Profile Management
**As a user**, I want to manage my account settings and profile so that I can customize my experience and maintain my preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Profile editing (name, email, avatar)
- [ ] Password change and account security
- [ ] Notification preferences management
- [ ] Account deletion and data export
- [ ] Two-factor authentication option
- [ ] Account activity log
- [ ] Privacy settings and data controls

## Technical Dependencies

**External:**
- Redis for message queue
- FFmpeg for video processing
- Stripe for payment processing
- Email service (SendGrid/AWS SES)

**Internal:**
- Epic 1: User authentication and database schema
- Epic 2: Visualization engine and rendering configuration

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All user stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Message queue system handling 100+ concurrent jobs
- [ ] Video rendering pipeline meeting performance targets
- [ ] User dashboard fully functional and responsive
- [ ] Subscription system integrated and tested
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Load testing passed for target capacity

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Video render completion time <2 minutes for 3-minute MIDI
- [ ] System handles 100+ concurrent render jobs
- [ ] User dashboard load time <1 second
- [ ] Subscription conversion rate >5% from free to paid
- [ ] Payment processing success rate >99%
- [ ] User retention rate >60% after 30 days

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Video rendering performance and scalability
**Mitigation:** Implement horizontal scaling with multiple worker nodes
**Rollback Plan:** Queue management to throttle jobs during high load

**Secondary Risk:** Stripe integration complexity and payment failures
**Mitigation:** Extensive testing in Stripe test mode, implement retry logic
**Rollback Plan:** Manual billing process while debugging payment issues

**Tertiary Risk:** Queue system reliability and job loss
**Mitigation:** Implement job persistence and duplicate detection
**Rollback Plan:** Fallback to synchronous processing for critical jobs

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Horizontal scaling of worker processes
- Database connection pooling and optimization
- CDN integration for video delivery
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth

**Security Requirements:**
- Video access control with pre-signed URLs
- User data encryption at rest and in transit
- Payment data compliance (PCI DSS considerations)
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Queue depth and worker utilization metrics
- Video rendering success/failure rates
- User activity and engagement analytics

## Business Integration

**Subscription Tiers:**
- **Free:** 5 renders/month, 720p max, watermark
- **Pro ($9.99/month):** 50 renders/month, 1080p, no watermark
- **Enterprise ($29.99/month):** Unlimited renders, 4K, priority processing

**Usage Limits:**
- File size limits by tier
- Concurrent rendering limits
- Storage quotas and retention policies
- API rate limiting by subscription level
