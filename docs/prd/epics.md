# Epics

* **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Upload**: Establish project setup, CI/CD, user authentication, and the ability for users to upload MIDI/audio files and see a basic, non-configurable visualization.
* **Epic 2: Interactive Visualization Engine**: Implement the real-time preview engine with selectable visualization styles (`three.js`/`p5.js`) and custom color schemes.
* **Epic 3: Backend Rendering & User Accounts**: Develop the backend rendering pipeline using a message queue and FFmpeg. Implement user dashboards for viewing projects and downloading completed videos.
* **Epic 4: Remotion Video Composition Platform**: Build the video composition and rendering system using Remotion for high-quality output.
* **Epic 5: Stem Separation & Audio Analysis**: Implement serverless audio stem separation and real-time analysis to provide a lower-friction alternative to MIDI file uploads, enabling automatic visualization control from single audio files.
