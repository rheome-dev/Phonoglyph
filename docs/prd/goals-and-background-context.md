# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* To provide music producers and content creators with a simple, web-based tool to generate compelling, customized visuals synced to their MIDI files.
* To offer a simpler, more accessible alternative to complex creative coding software like TouchDesigner or p5.js.
* To enable users to create short-form video content suitable for social media platforms.
* To establish a tiered SaaS model with free and paid features to support both casual and power users.

## Background Context

Phonoglyph is a web-based SaaS platform designed for musicians and content creators. The core problem it solves is the difficulty and high technical barrier required to create engaging, music-synced visuals for social media. While professional tools exist, they have a steep learning curve. Phonoglyph will offer a curated set of high-quality visualization styles ("Data Viz", "Gradient Flow", "Light Waves") and color schemes that users can apply to their MIDI files instantly, with a real-time preview editor and a backend rendering pipeline for high-quality video output.
