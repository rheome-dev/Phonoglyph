# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be intuitive and immediate. A user should be able to go from uploading a file to seeing a compelling visual in seconds. The interface will be clean and minimalist, focusing the user's attention on the visualizer canvas.

## Core Screens and Views

* **Landing/Upload Page**: A simple page with a clear call-to-action for file uploads.
* **Editor View**: The main interface, featuring the real-time preview canvas and controls for selecting styles, colors, and render settings.
* **Dashboard/Projects View**: For authenticated users to view their past projects and rendered videos.
* **Pricing/Subscription Page**: Outlines the different subscription tiers.
* **Login/Sign-up Page**: For user authentication.

## Target Device and Platforms

Web Responsive, targeting modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile web browsers.
