# Story 6.1: Core Post-Processing Effects Pipeline

## Story Description
Implement the foundational post-processing effects pipeline that will serve as the base for all video and generative content processing.

## Technical Details

### Core Requirements
1. Implement EffectComposer setup with Three.js
2. Create base post-processing pass system
3. Implement core effects:
   - Bloom/UnrealBloom
   - Color Grading/LUT
   - Glitch/Distortion
   - Depth/Focus effects
4. Create effect parameter management system
5. Implement MIDI/Audio reactivity system for effect parameters

### Implementation Notes

```typescript
interface PostProcessingPipeline {
  composer: EffectComposer;
  passes: Map<string, Pass>;
  
  // Effect management
  addPass(pass: Pass): void;
  removePass(name: string): void;
  reorderPasses(order: string[]): void;
  
  // Parameter control
  setParameter(passName: string, param: string, value: any): void;
  getParameter(passName: string, param: string): any;
  
  // MIDI/Audio routing
  bindToMIDI(passName: string, param: string, cc: number): void;
  bindToAudio(passName: string, param: string, feature: AudioFeature): void;
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Implement quality scaling system
- Use shared resources where possible
- Minimize render target switches
- Implement pass bypass system for inactive effects

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Pipeline
- [ ] EffectComposer successfully initialized
- [ ] Pass management system working
- [ ] Effect parameter system functional
- [ ] MIDI/Audio routing system operational

### Effects Implementation
- [ ] Bloom effect with HDR support
- [ ] Color grading with LUT support
- [ ] Glitch effect with time-based controls
- [ ] Depth effects with dynamic focus

### Performance
- [ ] Maintains 60fps with 4+ active effects
- [ ] Memory usage within budget
- [ ] Smooth parameter transitions

### Integration
- [ ] Works with both video and generated content
- [ ] MIDI control responsive (<16ms latency)
- [ ] Audio reactivity smooth and accurate
