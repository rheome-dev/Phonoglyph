## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1-1.5 Completion:**
- tRPC patterns established with protectedProcedure for authenticated actions
- Supabase auth context available with user.id for project ownership
- Database migration system working with automated schema updates
- Glassmorphism UI patterns established for consistent design
- Three.js visualizer ready for project-scoped integration

**From Story 1.3 (File Upload):**
- File metadata system exists but needs project association
- R2 storage patterns established for asset management
- Upload confirmation flow ready for project context
- File validation and security measures implemented

### Data Models
**Enhanced Project Interface:**
```typescript
interface ProjectExtended {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  genre?: string;
  privacy_setting: 'private' | 'unlisted' | 'public';
  thumbnail_url?: string;
  primary_midi_file_id?: string;
  user_id: string; // UUID from Supabase auth.users
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  // Computed fields
  file_count?: number;
  total_file_size?: number;
  last_accessed?: string;
}
```

**Project Sharing Interface:**
```typescript
interface ProjectShare {
  id: string;
  project_id: string;
  share_token: string; // unique URL token
  access_type: 'view' | 'embed';
  expires_at?: string;
  view_count: number;
  created_at: string;
}
```

**Database Schema Extensions:**
```sql
-- Extend existing projects table
ALTER TABLE projects 
ADD COLUMN description TEXT,
ADD COLUMN genre TEXT,
ADD COLUMN privacy_setting TEXT DEFAULT 'private' CHECK (privacy_setting IN ('private', 'unlisted', 'public')),
ADD COLUMN thumbnail_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN primary_midi_file_id TEXT;

-- Create project sharing table
CREATE TABLE project_shares (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  share_token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  access_type TEXT DEFAULT 'view' CHECK (access_type IN ('view', 'embed')),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add project relationship to file_metadata
ALTER TABLE file_metadata 
ADD COLUMN project_id TEXT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_genre ON projects(genre);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_privacy ON projects(privacy_setting);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_shares_token ON project_shares(share_token);
CREATE INDEX idx_file_metadata_project ON file_metadata(project_id);
```

### File Locations
**Enhanced Project Management** [Source: apps/api/src/routers/project.ts]:
- Existing project router to be extended: `apps/api/src/routers/project.ts`
- New migration file: `apps/api/src/db/migrations/008_enhanced_project_management.sql`
- Project components: `apps/web/src/components/projects/`
- Project pages: `apps/web/src/app/projects/` and `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/`

**New UI Components:**
- Project creation modal: `apps/web/src/components/projects/project-creation-modal.tsx`
- Project dashboard: `apps/web/src/components/projects/project-dashboard.tsx`
- Project card: `apps/web/src/components/projects/project-card.tsx`
- Project settings: `apps/web/src/components/projects/project-settings.tsx`
- Breadcrumb navigation: `apps/web/src/components/layout/breadcrumb-nav.tsx`

### Technical Constraints
**Existing Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS for project privacy
- Cloudflare R2 for thumbnail and asset storage
- Next.js App Router for project pages and navigation
- tRPC for type-safe project management API
- Glassmorphism design system with shadcn/ui

**Performance Requirements:**
- Project dashboard load time: <2 seconds for 100+ projects
- Project creation: <500ms response time
- Search/filtering: <200ms real-time response
- Thumbnail generation: <5 seconds for MIDI files

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Vitest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 85%
  - Project creation with validation
  - Project duplication with asset cloning
  - Project deletion with cascade cleanup
  - Search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Vitest Integration Test: location: `tests/integration/project-management.spec.ts`
  - End-to-end project lifecycle (create, update, duplicate, delete)
  - Project sharing and access control
  - File association with projects
- [ ] E2E Tests: location: `tests/e2e/project-workflows.spec.ts`
  - Complete project creation flow

  - Project settings and sharing

Manual Test Steps:
- Create new project with all fields and verify database storage
- Test project dashboard loading with pagination and search
- Verify project sharing URLs work in incognito mode
- Test project duplication copies all assets correctly
