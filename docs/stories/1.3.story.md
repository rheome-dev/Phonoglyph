## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1 Completion Notes:**
- tRPC setup used simplified client configuration - file upload endpoints will integrate cleanly
- Environment files use .env.example format - AWS credentials should follow same pattern
- Database migrations work well - extend for file metadata tables

**From Story 1.2 (Supabase Auth):**
- User authentication context available in tRPC procedures
- Protected procedures implemented with Supabase session validation
- User ID (UUID) available for file ownership tracking

### Data Models
**File Metadata Interface:**
```typescript
interface FileMetadata {
  id: string;
  userId: string; // UUID from Supabase auth.users
  fileName: string;
  fileType: 'midi' | 'audio';
  mimeType: string;
  fileSize: number; // bytes
  s3Key: string; // S3 object key
  s3Bucket: string; // S3 bucket name
  uploadStatus: 'uploading' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Database Schema Extension:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "file_metadata" (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "user_id" UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "file_name" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "file_type" TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (file_type IN ('midi', 'audio')),
  "mime_type" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "file_size" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "s3_key" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "s3_bucket" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "upload_status" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'uploading',
  "created_at" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updated_at" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL
);
```

### API Specifications
**tRPC File Upload Endpoints:**
```typescript
export const fileRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  // Generate pre-signed URL for upload
  getUploadUrl: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      fileName: z.string(),
      fileType: z.enum(['midi', 'audio']),
      fileSize: z.number()
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Validate file size limits
      // Generate S3 pre-signed URL
      // Create file metadata record
    }),

  // Confirm upload completion
  confirmUpload: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ fileId: z.string() }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Update file status to completed
      // Trigger any post-upload processing
    }),

  // List user files
  getUserFiles: protectedProcedure
    .query(async ({ ctx }) => {
      // Return user's uploaded files
    })
});
```

### File Locations
**File Upload Implementation** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Upload API routes: `apps/api/src/routers/file.ts`
- S3 utilities: `apps/api/src/services/s3.ts`
- Upload components: `apps/web/src/components/upload/`
- File validation: `apps/api/src/lib/file-validation.ts`
- Database models: `apps/api/src/models/file.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Versions** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- AWS S3: N/A (cloud service)
- File upload handling: Built into tRPC and Next.js
- File validation libraries: file-type, multer (if needed)
- Progress tracking: Native File API and fetch

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]:
- All uploaded files must be scanned and validated on backend
- All user content accessed through short-lived pre-signed URLs
- Authentication required for all file operations (protected procedures)

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=midiviz-uploads

# File Upload Limits
MAX_MIDI_FILE_SIZE=5242880  # 5MB in bytes
MAX_AUDIO_FILE_SIZE=52428800  # 50MB in bytes
```

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Vitest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Vitest Integration Test: location: `tests/integration/file-upload.spec.ts`
- [ ] Playwright E2E Test: location: `tests/e2e/file-upload.spec.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Upload various MIDI files (.mid, .midi) and verify successful processing
- Upload audio files (.mp3, .wav) within size limits
- Test file size limit enforcement (5MB MIDI, 50MB audio)
- Verify upload progress indication works correctly
- Test error handling for invalid file types and corrupted files
- Verify file metadata is stored correctly in database
- Test file deletion and cleanup functionality
- Verify files are only accessible to file owners (security)
