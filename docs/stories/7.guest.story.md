# Story 7.G: Guest User Access to Creative Visualizer

**Epic**: 7 - MVP Consolidation & Production Readiness  
**Story**: 7.G  
**Status**: Not Started ðŸ”´  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 10 hours  
**Dependencies**: Epic 1 âœ…, Epic 2 âœ…, Story 7.1 ðŸ”´

## User Story

**As a** guest visitor (not logged in)  
**I want** to access the creative visualizer, be prompted with the project creation modal, upload my files, and use the visualizer  
**So that** I can try the product without an account, and only be prompted to sign up when I save or export my work

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Guest Access Flow**
- Direct access to /creative-visualizer for unauthenticated users
- Immediately show project creation modal (not project picker)
- Allow upload of audio/MIDI files (optionally: demo stems)
- Enable full use of creative visualizer features (editing, preview, effects)
- Restrict saving/exporting: prompt sign up/login only when user attempts to save/export
- Store guest project state in local/session storage until sign up
- On sign up, migrate guest project to user account

### **Frontend Implementation**
- Guest mode detection and routing
- Project creation modal as default for guests
- File upload and validation for guests
- Local/session storage for guest project state
- Sign up modal/redirect on save/export
- UI indicators for guest mode

### **Backend Integration**
- Temporary guest project endpoints (if needed)
- Migration logic for guest-to-user project
- Restrict backend save/export endpoints to authenticated users

## Acceptance Criteria

### ðŸ‘¤ **Guest Access**
- [ ] **AC1**: Guest users can open the creative visualizer without an account
- [ ] **AC2**: Project creation modal is shown immediately for guests
- [ ] **AC3**: Project picker is never shown to guests
- [ ] **AC4**: Guests can upload audio/MIDI files and use all editor features
- [ ] **AC5**: Guest project state is stored locally until sign up
- [ ] **AC6**: Guests are prompted to sign up only when saving or exporting
- [ ] **AC7**: On sign up, guest project is migrated to user account

### âš¡ **Performance & Integration**
- [ ] **AC8**: Guest mode is clearly indicated in UI
- [ ] **AC9**: Guest experience is seamless and matches logged-in users (except for save/export)
- [ ] **AC10**: No backend data is stored for guests until sign up

## Technical Dependencies

### External Libraries
- **Local/session storage utilities**
- **UI component library for modals and notifications**

### Internal Dependencies
- **Epic 1: Project foundation and routing**
- **Epic 2: Creative visualizer and project creation modal**
- **Story 7.1: Persistent editing (for local storage)**

## Implementation Tasks

### Frontend Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement guest mode detection and routing
- [ ] **Task 2**: Show project creation modal by default for guests
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement file upload and validation for guests
- [ ] **Task 4**: Store guest project state in local/session storage
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add UI indicators for guest mode
- [ ] **Task 6**: Prompt sign up on save/export
- [ ] **Task 7**: Migrate guest project to user account on sign up

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] **Task 8**: Restrict save/export endpoints to authenticated users
- [ ] **Task 9**: Implement guest-to-user project migration logic

## Integration Verification

### Existing System Compatibility
- **IV1**: Creative visualizer works for both guests and logged-in users
- **IV2**: Project creation modal is default for guests
- **IV3**: Guest project state is preserved until sign up
- **IV4**: Save/export is restricted to authenticated users

### Performance Requirements
- **IV5**: Guest mode loads in under 2 seconds
- **IV6**: Project migration on sign up completes in under 1 second

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] **Guest-to-signup conversion rate >20%**
- [ ] **Guest session completion rate >80%**
- [ ] **Guest satisfaction with editor >90%**

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] **Guest mode load time <2s**
- [ ] **Project migration success rate >99%**

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **Epic 1**: Routing and project creation modal
- **Epic 2**: Creative visualizer foundation
- **Story 7.1**: Persistent editing for local storage

### Data Models
- Guest project state (local/session storage structure)
- Migration logic for guest-to-user project

### File Locations
**Frontend Implementation**:
- `apps/web/src/app/creative-visualizer/page.tsx` - Guest mode logic
- `apps/web/src/components/project-creation-modal/` - Modal logic
- `apps/web/src/lib/guest-user.ts` - Guest state utilities

**Backend Implementation**:
- `apps/api/src/routers/guest.ts` - Guest endpoints (if needed)
- `apps/api/src/services/guest.ts` - Guest migration logic

### Technical Constraints
- **Must not store backend data for guests until sign up**
- **Must provide seamless migration to user account**
- **Must not degrade performance for logged-in users**

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Vitest Unit Tests**: Guest mode utilities (coverage: 90%)
- [ ] **Vitest Integration Tests**: Guest-to-user migration
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: Guest access, editing, and sign up flow
