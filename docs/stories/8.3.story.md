# Story 8.3: Fix Media Processing Security Vulnerabilities

**Epic**: 8 - Code Quality & Production Stability  
**Story**: 8.3  
**Status**: Not Started üî¥  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 16 hours  
**Dependencies**: None

## User Story

**As a** user  
**I want** my uploaded media files to be properly validated and securely processed  
**So that** I can trust the platform with my content and know my files are handled safely

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Critical Security Issue Identified**
The media processor contains placeholder implementations that bypass actual file processing and security validation, creating serious security vulnerabilities in production.

### **Affected Files and Lines**
- **File**: `apps/api/src/services/media-processor.ts`
- **Lines**: 60-63 (placeholder thumbnail generation)
- **Lines**: 126-151 (processUploadedFile with incomplete validation)
- **File**: `apps/api/src/lib/file-validation.ts`
- **Lines**: 108-146 (incomplete magic byte validation)

### **Current Problematic Implementation**
```typescript
// TODO: Replace with actual ffmpeg thumbnail generation
// const thumbnail = await this.runFFMpeg(buffer, timestampSec);

return placeholderJpeg
```

### **Required Security Implementation**
```typescript
interface SecureMediaProcessor {
  validateFileContent(buffer: Buffer, expectedType: string): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  scanForMalware(buffer: Buffer): Promise<ScanResult>;
  generateSecureThumbnail(buffer: Buffer, options: ThumbnailOptions): Promise<Buffer>;
  extractMetadataSafely(buffer: Buffer): Promise<MediaMetadata>;
  sanitizeFileName(filename: string): string;
}

interface ValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  detectedType: string;
  securityIssues: SecurityIssue[];
  confidence: number;
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### üîí **File Content Validation**
- [ ] **AC1**: All uploaded files undergo magic byte validation to verify actual file type
- [ ] **AC2**: File content is scanned for embedded malicious code or scripts
- [ ] **AC3**: Video and image files are validated using proper media libraries (ffmpeg/sharp)
- [ ] **AC4**: Audio files are validated for proper format and structure
- [ ] **AC5**: Rejected files provide clear, secure error messages without exposing system details

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Processing**
- [ ] **AC6**: Thumbnail generation uses secure ffmpeg processing with sandboxing
- [ ] **AC7**: Metadata extraction is performed safely without executing embedded code
- [ ] **AC8**: File processing occurs in isolated environment with resource limits
- [ ] **AC9**: Temporary files are securely cleaned up after processing
- [ ] **AC10**: Processing logs do not expose sensitive file content or paths

### üìÅ **File Handling Security**
- [ ] **AC11**: Uploaded files are stored with randomized names to prevent path traversal
- [ ] **AC12**: File size limits are enforced at multiple validation layers
- [ ] **AC13**: MIME type validation matches actual file content
- [ ] **AC14**: Executable file detection prevents upload of dangerous file types
- [ ] **AC15**: File quarantine system isolates suspicious uploads

## Technical Dependencies

- **sharp for secure image processing**
- **file-type for magic byte detection**
- **clamav or similar for malware scanning**

### Internal Dependencies
- **Existing file upload system**

## Risk Assessment

### **Security Risk: CRITICAL**
- **Risk**: Malicious file uploads compromising system security
- **Impact**: System compromise, data breach, service disruption
- **Likelihood**: High (current system has minimal validation)
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive security validation, sandboxed processing, monitoring

### **Performance Risk: MEDIUM**
- **Risk**: Security processing causing significant upload delays
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, timeouts
- **Likelihood**: Medium (security processing is resource-intensive)
- **Mitigation**: Asynchronous processing, progress indicators, optimization

### **Compatibility Risk: LOW**
- **Risk**: Enhanced validation rejecting previously accepted files
- **Impact**: User confusion, lost uploads
- **Likelihood**: Low (with proper testing)
- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout, clear error messages, user education

## Success Metrics

### Security Metrics
- [ ] **100% of uploads undergo content validation**
- [ ] **Zero malicious files reach storage**
- [ ] **All thumbnails generated through secure processing**
- [ ] **No security incidents related to file uploads**

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] **File processing latency <10 seconds for typical files**
- [ ] **Security validation adds <2 seconds to upload time**
- [ ] **System remains responsive during file processing**

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] **Upload success rate >98% for valid files**
- [ ] **Clear error messages for 100% of rejected files**
- [ ] **User satisfaction with upload security >90%**
