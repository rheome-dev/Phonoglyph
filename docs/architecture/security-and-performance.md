# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

* **Authentication**: All user-specific endpoints must be protected procedures.
* **File Uploads**: All uploaded files must be scanned and validated on the backend before processing.
* **Content Access**: All user content in S3 will be accessed exclusively through short-lived pre-signed URLs.

## Performance Optimization

* **Frontend**: Leverage Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) of initial pages and client-side navigation for speed.
* **Backend**: The API will be stateless for horizontal scaling. The rendering process is offloaded to a separate, scalable service.
* **Database**: Utilize read replicas for the PostgreSQL database if read traffic becomes a bottleneck.
