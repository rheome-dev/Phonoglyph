## Database Schema Extensions Required

### New Tables for Project Management
```sql
-- Projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  genre TEXT,
  privacy_setting TEXT DEFAULT 'private' CHECK (privacy_setting IN ('private', 'unlisted', 'public')),
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  primary_midi_file_id TEXT, -- References file_metadata(id)
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Extend existing file_metadata table
ALTER TABLE file_metadata 
ADD COLUMN project_id TEXT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
ADD COLUMN asset_type TEXT CHECK (asset_type IN ('midi', 'audio', 'video', 'image')),
ADD COLUMN is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN thumbnail_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN duration_seconds FLOAT,
ADD COLUMN resolution_width INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN resolution_height INTEGER;

-- Update file_type enum to include new types
ALTER TYPE file_type_enum ADD VALUE 'video';
ALTER TYPE file_type_enum ADD VALUE 'image';

-- Project compositions (for future Remotion integration)
CREATE TABLE project_compositions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id TEXT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  composition_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_user_id ON projects(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_file_metadata_project_id ON file_metadata(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_created_at ON projects(created_at DESC);
```

## API Extensions Required

### New Project Router
```typescript
export const projectRouter = router({
  // Project CRUD operations
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
      description: z.string().max(500).optional(),
      genre: z.string().optional()
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Create new project with user association
    }),

  list: protectedProcedure
    .query(async ({ ctx }) => {
      // Return user's projects with pagination and filtering
    }),

  get: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ projectId: z.string() }))
    .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Return specific project with associated assets
    }),

  // Project asset management
  getAssets: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ 
      projectId: z.string(),
      assetType: z.enum(['midi', 'audio', 'video', 'image', 'all']).default('all')
    }))
    .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Return project-scoped assets by type
    }),

  setPrimaryMidi: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      projectId: z.string(),
      fileId: z.string()
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Set primary MIDI file for project
    })
});

// Extend existing file router to require project association
export const fileRouter = router({
  getUploadUrl: protectedProcedure
    .input(FileUploadSchema.extend({
      projectId: z.string() // Now required for new uploads
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Validate project ownership and create upload URL
    })
});
```
