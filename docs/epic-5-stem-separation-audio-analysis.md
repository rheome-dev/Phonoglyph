# Epic 5: Stem Separation & Audio Analysis

## Epic Goal

Implement a serverless audio stem separation pipeline using Spleeter and **pre-analyzed audio system** to provide a lower-friction alternative to MIDI file uploads for music visualization with **waveform visualization and feature markers**.

- Expands target market to include users without MIDI expertise
- Maintains high-quality visualization control through **pre-computed analysis**
- Enables future ML-based enhancement of audio understanding
- Provides foundation for more sophisticated audio-reactive features
- **Cost-effective processing through optimized stem separation and cached analysis**
- **Rich waveform visualization with feature markers enhances user experience**

**Technical Scope:**
- Serverless stem separation using Spleeter
- **Pre-analyzed audio system with cached results**
- **Waveform visualization with feature markers**
- **Custom audio analysis without Meyda.js dependency**
- Automated musical feature extraction
- Integration with existing visualization engine
