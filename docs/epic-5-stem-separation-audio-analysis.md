- Expands target market to include users without MIDI expertise
- Maintains high-quality visualization control through automated analysis
- Enables future ML-based enhancement of audio understanding
- Provides foundation for more sophisticated audio-reactive features
- Cost-effective processing through optimized stem separation

**Technical Scope:**
- Serverless stem separation using Spleeter
- Real-time audio analysis with Meyda.js
- WebAudio API integration for live processing
- Automated musical feature extraction
- Integration with existing visualization engine
