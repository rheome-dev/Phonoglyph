# Epic 5: Stem Separation & Audio Analysis

## Epic Goal

Implement a serverless audio stem separation pipeline using Spleeter and cached audio analysis system to provide a lower-friction alternative to MIDI file uploads for music visualization with waveform visualization and feature markers.

## Epic Description

**Primary Objective:** Build an automated stem separation system using Spleeter and comprehensive cached audio analysis pipeline that enables users to upload a single audio file and receive visualization capabilities similar to MIDI-based control, reducing the barrier to entry while maintaining creative control. Analysis happens during upload, not during playback, providing instant visualization data and rich waveform displays.

**Business Value:**
- Reduces user friction by eliminating need for separate MIDI file preparation
- Expands target market to include users without MIDI expertise
- Maintains high-quality visualization control through pre-computed analysis
- Enables future ML-based enhancement of audio understanding
- Provides foundation for more sophisticated audio-reactive features
- Cost-effective processing through optimized stem separation and cached analysis
- Rich waveform visualization with feature markers enhances user experience

**Technical Scope:**
- Serverless stem separation using Spleeter
- Cached audio analysis with comprehensive feature extraction
- Backend processing with database caching for performance
- Automated musical feature extraction with 15+ audio features
- Integration with existing visualization engine
