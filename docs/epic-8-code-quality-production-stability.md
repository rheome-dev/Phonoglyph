# Epic 8: Code Quality & Production Stability

**Epic Goal**: Address critical code quality issues and production blockers identified in the comprehensive code audit to ensure Phonoglyph is ready for stable production deployment.

**Epic Status**: Not Started ðŸ”´  
**Epic Priority**: Critical  
**Total Estimated Effort**: 130 hours  
**Dependencies**: Epic 7 (MVP Consolidation) ðŸ”´

## Epic Overview

### **Critical Context**
A comprehensive code quality audit revealed several critical production blockers and performance issues that must be addressed before Phonoglyph can be safely deployed to production. These issues range from security vulnerabilities to mock data systems that could provide fake results to users.

### **Epic Scope**
This epic focuses on addressing the most critical code quality issues identified in the audit:

1. **Production Blockers (Phase 1)**: Mock data systems, placeholder implementations, security vulnerabilities
2. **Performance Issues (Phase 2)**: Type safety gaps, database type safety, API consolidation
3. **Production Infrastructure (Phase 3)**: API layer consolidation, feature usage tracking, monitoring stack

### **Phase 3: Production Infrastructure (44 hours)**

#### **Story 8.7: Implement Feature Usage and Credit System** (20 hours)
- **Priority**: High
- **Risk**: No usage tracking for SaaS monetization
- **Impact**: Revenue tracking, user tier management, cost optimization
- **Files**: Credit tracking service, usage monitoring, billing integration

#### **Story 8.8: Implement Production Monitoring Stack (PostHog + Sentry)** (16 hours)
- **Priority**: High
- **Risk**: No visibility into production issues
- **Impact**: Proactive issue detection, user analytics, performance monitoring
- **Files**: Monitoring configuration, error tracking, analytics integration

#### **Story 8.9: Audio Processing Pipeline Monitoring and Alerting** (8 hours)
- **Priority**: High
- **Risk**: Silent failures in audio processing
- **Impact**: Reliable audio processing, automated issue detection
- **Files**: Pipeline monitoring, alert configuration, health checks

## Technical Architecture

### **Enhanced API Architecture**
```typescript
// Consolidated tRPC API layer replacing Express endpoints
export const appRouter = router({
  // Existing routers enhanced with Drizzle
  health: healthRouter,
  auth: authRouter,
  user: userRouter,
  project: projectRouter,
  file: fileRouter,
  midi: midiRouter,
  stem: stemRouter,
  
  // New production-ready routers
  credits: creditsRouter,      // Usage tracking and billing
  monitoring: monitoringRouter, // Health checks and metrics
  analytics: analyticsRouter,   // User behavior tracking
});

// Feature usage tracking integration
interface FeatureUsage {
  userId: string;
  feature: 'render' | 'stem_separation' | 'ai_generation' | 'storage';
  usage: number;
  cost: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Monitoring and observability
interface MonitoringConfig {
  sentry: SentryConfig;
  postHog: PostHogConfig;
  audioProcessing: AudioMonitoringConfig;
  alerting: AlertingConfig;
}
```

### **Production Monitoring Requirements**
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for all API routes and audio processing
- **User Analytics**: PostHog for feature usage, conversion tracking, and user behavior
- **Performance Monitoring**: Audio processing pipeline health checks and latency tracking
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time usage monitoring for SaaS billing and optimization
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for critical failures and performance degradation
