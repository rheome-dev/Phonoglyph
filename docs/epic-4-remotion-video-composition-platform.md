## Technical Implementation Details

### Remotion Integration Architecture
```typescript
// Composition structure
const MidiVisualizerComposition: React.FC<{
  midiData: MIDIData;
  videoLayers: VideoLayer[];
  effectLayers: EffectLayer[];
  audioSrc: string;
}> = ({ midiData, videoLayers, effectLayers, audioSrc }) => {
  return (
    <Composition>
      <Audio src={audioSrc} />
      {videoLayers.map(layer => (
        <VideoLayer 
          key={layer.id} 
          {...layer} 
          midiBindings={layer.midiBindings}
          frame={useCurrentFrame()}
        />
      ))}
      {effectLayers.map(effect => (
        <ThreeJSEffectLayer
          key={effect.id}
          effect={effect}
          midiData={midiData}
          frame={useCurrentFrame()}
        />
      ))}
    </Composition>
  );
};
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **Canvas-to-Video Bridge:** Efficient Three.js canvas capture for Remotion
- **Frame Caching:** Cache complex Three.js renders for smooth playback
- **Lazy Loading:** Load video assets only when needed in timeline
- **Background Processing:** Pre-render heavy effects during idle time
- **Quality Scaling:** Adaptive quality based on device capabilities

## API Extensions Required

### New Video Composition Router
```typescript
export const videoCompositionRouter = router({
  // Composition CRUD operations
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      projectId: z.string(),
      name: z.string(),
      layers: z.array(layerSchema),
      duration: z.number()
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Create new video composition
    }),

  // Export operations
  export: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      compositionId: z.string(),
      format: z.enum(['mp4', 'webm', 'gif']),
      quality: z.enum(['draft', 'medium', 'high'])
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Queue video export with Remotion
    }),

  // Real-time preview
  preview: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      compositionId: z.string(),
      frame: z.number()
    }))
    .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Generate preview frame
    })
});
```
